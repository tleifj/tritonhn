	<div class="big">Frequently asked questions about Triton’s proteins and products</div>
      <p><strong>How does the Triton production process work?</strong></p>
      <p>Triton enhances algal genomes, creating strains that produce high levels of valuable and useful natural proteins. Many of these are proteins cannot be produced in other organisms (such as bacteria and yeast), and others cannot be produced economically and at scale in those organisms that can make them (such as CHO cells).</p>
      <p>Triton’s approach enables production of a large number of these high-value proteins at comparatively low cost.</p>
      <p>This method of engineering algae is similar to that of engineering bacteria or animal cells. In sum, Triton uses the same basic tools and approaches developed over the past four decades for use in other traditional systems; however Triton’s scientists have spent more than 25 years learning how to apply these tools to algae. This approach enables Triton to rapidly create new strains of algae that produce a variety of proteins.  Triton holds extensive intellectual property on the specific processes and methods for enhancing algae in this manner, as well as for each product it has developed.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>What are Triton's proteins?</strong></p>
      <p>Triton is developing a family of complex orally deliverable proteins - which are biologically identical to those occurring in nature - that have well-documented beneficial effects on both infants and adults. These proteins are safe and biologically active, and have shown positive health effects in areas such as digestive health, bone strength and density, oral health, and cognitive development.  Triton’s has a large and diverse portfolio of these proteins that we will bring to market, such as osteopontin (OPN), lactadherin (LHN) and mammary associated amyloid (MAA).</p>
      
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>What is Osteopontin (OPN)?</strong></p>
      <p>OPN is a colostrum and milk protein, which interacts with multiple systems in the body of all mammals, including the immune system; it also supports bone growth/resorption and accelerates wound healing.  Additionally, OPN has been shown to induce production of immune cells, and to support brain and cognitive development.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>What is Lactadherin (LHN)?</strong></p>
      <p>LHN is an important protein component of colostrum and milk, conserved across all vertebrates.  It supports the immune system in finding and removing dead cells which create inflammation; plays an important role in maintaining normal health of the intestinal mucosa, and; helps support natural defense against rotavirus infections, a common cause of nausea and diarrhea among infants and young children.

      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>What is Mammary Associated Amyloid (MAA)?</strong></p>
      <p>MAA is found in the colostrum of all mammals, and helps stimulate production of a mucus coating in the digestive tract.  These coatings help to prevent colonization of pathogenic bacteria, minimize viral infection, and improve nutrient intake by the intestines.  It is active in mammals of all ages, and holds great potential to support normal, healthy intestinal function in humans, companion animals, and livestock. </p>
        
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>How is MAA being commercialized?</strong></p>
        <p>Triton is commercializing MAA via strategic partnerships with algae producers and marketing and distribution companies. Further details on these relationships will be announced soon.</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>What are possible future products?</strong></p>
        <ul>
       	  <li>infant formula: colostrum proteins are abundant in breast milk, but absent in infant formula.  Triton’s intends to provide certain key proteins, such as OPN, as safe, healthy and natural ingredients to infant formula manufacturers.</li>
            <li>antibacterials/antimicrobials:  these are naturally occurring mammalian proteins that have high efficacy against bacteria, fungi and viruses, and in impeding infections.  Further, they do not create resistance in bacteria, and serve as a natural substitute for chemical-based antibiotics.
</li>
            <li>bone strength enhancement:  proteins that support the body in more effectively binding calcium in bone matrices; recent studies indicate the potential for eventually addressing the effects of osteoporosis.
</li>
            <li>Digestive health:  proteins that help support regular digestive function and health.

</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Other potential products could include antioxidants, DNA repair enzymes, growth factors, vaccines, and anti-cancer agents. 
</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>What are the future markets?</strong></p>
      <p>Triton’s products have broad potential applications across multiple industries; in the near term, it is targeting product demand in the global infant formula market, as well as the companion animal and livestock feed markets.

        In 2013, Triton entered a development partnership with Heliae, a leading algae production and technology company.</p>
 
		<p>This partnership is focused on the production of Mammary Associated Amyloid (MAA), the first in Triton’s PhycoShield&trade; product line. Triton’s proprietary MAA algae will be produced using Heliae’s Volaris&trade; advanced algae technology platform. Heliae’s Volaris platform is uniquely equipped to support Triton’s proprietary strains.  Volaris combines the best of existing algae production models to produce high-value products with lower capital costs, optimized productivity, and increased product optionality.  As the partnership progresses, Heliae and Triton aim to deploy an extensive pipeline of Triton’s advanced algae strains using Volaris.  Through this partnership, Triton’s MAA is expected to be commercially available in 2014.</p>
        
        <p>Heliae is a platform technology company that uses sunlight and low-cost carbon feedstocks to produce high-value products from algae. Based in Gilbert, Ariz., Heliae is leveraging its core production technology into four target markets: nutrition, therapeutics, health &amp; beauty, and agrosciences. With a seasoned management team and world-class science, Heliae is advancing the future of the algae industry by delivering novel algae-based products to dynamic markets around the world.</p>

He holds the John Doves Isaacs Chair of Natural Philosophy in the department of Biology. His research focuses on the molecular genetics of green algae, and on the production of high value recombinant proteins and biofuel molecules using algae as a production platform. Dr. Mayfield received BS degrees in Biochemistry and Plant Biology from Cal Poly State University in San Luis Obispo, and a PhD in Molecular Genetics from UC Berkeley. Following a post-doctoral fellowship at the University of Geneva Switzerland he returned to California as an assistant professor at the Scripps Research Institute where he was the first person to achieve transformation of a green algae nuclear genome. Dr. Mayfield remained at Scripps for 22 years becoming the Associate Dean of Biology before joining UC San Diego in 2009.</p>
          <p>Dr. Mayfield has been a pioneer in algae biotechnology and was the first to achieve transformation of green algae and the first to show high levels of recombinant protein expression in algae, setting the stage for the use of algae as a platform for recombinant protein production, including the expression of human therapeutic proteins. These studies resulted in the founding of Rincon Pharmaceutical, a company based on the low cost production of human therapeutics using eukaryotic algae as an expression platform. Dr. Mayfield is a scientific founder of Sapphire Energy, the world’s largest company developing biofuels in algae and photosynthetic bacteria.</p>

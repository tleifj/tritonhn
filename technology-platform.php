	<div class="big">The Triton Platform: oral delivery of natural proteins that are simple, safe, and effective</div>
      <p>Triton Health and Nutrition has developed a unique and patent-protected platform, which enables the oral delivery of bioactive proteins that are simple, safe, and effective.  These highly effective natural proteins can improve animal and human health without the use of antibiotics or hormones.</p>
      <p>Triton enhances algal genomes, creating strains that produce high levels of valuable and useful proteins. Many of these are proteins cannot be produced in other organisms (such as bacteria or yeast), and others cannot be produced economically and at scale in those organisms that can make them (such as CHO cells). Triton’s approach enables production of a large number of these high-value proteins at comparatively low cost.</p>

      <p>The methods for engineering algae cells are similar to those used to engineer bacteria or animal cells. In sum, Triton uses the same basic tools and approaches developed over the past four decades for use in other traditional systems; however Triton’s scientists have spent more than 25 years learning how to apply these tools to algae. This approach enables Triton to rapidly create new strains of algae that produce a variety of proteins.  Triton holds extensive intellectual property on the specific processes and methods for enhancing algae in this manner, as well as for the products we have developed.  Triton is using this technology to create the next generation of products.</p>

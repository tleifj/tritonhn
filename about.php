      <div class="big">Triton Health and Nutrition is a biotechnology company that is transforming human and animal health with safe, effective and time-tested proteins that are identical to those occurring in nature.  These proteins are in demand across a number of large and growing markets.</div>
      <p>* Infant Formula:  the global infant formula market is large, and is one of the most rapidly expanding market segments.  In China alone, this market is growing at an annual rate of 20%, and accounts for nearly one-quarter of worldwide consumption of infant formula.  In China and elsewhere, fewer infants are able to be exclusively breast-fed, and infant formula as currently constituted lacks many of the essential proteins, such as OPN, that occur naturally in human milk, and are critical to normal infant growth and cognitive development. The result is a strong and increasing market demand for formulas that more closely resemble the composition and functionality of breast milk.  Multiple studies have found that as compared to formula fed infants, babies who breast feed:
</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Score 5.2 points higher on IQ tests (American Journal of Clinical Nutrition);</li>
        <li>Are 40% less likely to develop diabetes before 40 in some communities (The Lancet)</li>
        <li>Have more immune-boosting flora in their digestive systems (Genome Biology);</li>
        <li>Are 50% less likely to suffer from asthma symptoms (European Respiratory Journal)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>* Livestock:  the livestock industry today faces many challenges: current tools and treatments (including the common use of antibiotics) are being removed from the market and/or becoming less effective. Diarrheal diseases in animals alone cost more than $5 billion per year globally. These factors are increasing the cost of raising livestock, increasing consumer costs, and weakening the security and safety of the food production chain. As antibiotics use declines in Europe and the U.S., there is increasing demand for alternative, effective natural solutions.

</p>
      <p>* Companion animals:  similarly, the companion animal market is constantly seeking new means to improve pet health without compromising safety. Tritonâ€™s products can address these unmet needs with natural proteins that can improve the well-being and lifespan of pets by using natural bioactive proteins.
</p>
      <p>Triton Algae Innovations is developing a series of proteins for oral delivery that are simple, safe, and effective, and which can help to meet the market demands outlined above. These highly effective natural proteins can improve animal and human health without the use of artificial antibiotics or hormones.</p>

      <p>
        Building on more than 25 years of research, Triton has developed algae strains that produce these high-value proteins. Both the algae and the proteins expressed from them have been shown to be reliably safe and effective. As a result, Triton can deliver its products in whole algae, without having to purify the active compounds, meaning that these proteins can be orally delivered to animals and humans, efficiently and cost-effectively.

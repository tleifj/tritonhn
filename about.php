      <div class="big">Triton Health and Nutrition is a biotechnology company working to transform animal and human health with powerful and time-tested proteins identical to those occurring in nature.</div>
      <p>The livestock industry today faces many challenges: current tools and treatments (including the common use of controversial antibiotics) are being removed from the market and/or becoming less effective, resulting in increased animal morbidity and mortality. Diarrheal diseases in animals alone cost more than $5 billion per year globally. These factors are increasing the cost of raising livestock, increasing consumer costs, and weakening the security and safety of the food production chain. As antibiotics are phased out in Europe and the U.S., there is great need for alternative, high-efficacy natural solutions.
</p>
      <p>Similarly, the companion animal market is constantly searching for new means to improve pet health without compromising safety.  Tritonâ€™s products address these unmet needs with natural proteins that can improve the well-being and lifespan of pets by using natural bioactive proteins.
</p>
      <p>Triton Health and Nutrition has developed a series of proteins for oral delivery that are simple, safe, and effective. These highly effective natural proteins can improve animal and human health without the use of artificial antibiotics or hormones. </p>
      <p>Building on more than 25 years of research, Triton has developed algae strains that produce these high-value proteins. Both these algae and the resulting proteins have been shown to be reliably safe and effective. As a result, Triton can deliver its products in whole algae, without having to purify the active compounds, meaning that these proteins can be efficiently and cost-effectively delivered to animals and humans.</p>

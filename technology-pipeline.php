	<div class="big">Triton has a pipeline of safe and effective proteins, identical to those occurring in nature, and a powerful IP-protected platform from which to produce them.
</div>
	<p>The Triton platform enables production of a broad, diverse and valuable array of safe and effective - natural proteins.  These proteins including enzymes, antibodies, hormones and other biologically active proteins that represent multiple classes of proteins; including antibacterial, antioxidant, chelator, and mineral binding proteins.  Each of these proteins represents potentially high-value products in multiple market sectors, including infant formula, nutraceuticals, therapeutics and cosmetics.  The first proteins to emerge from Tritonâ€™s platform - osteopontin (OPN), lactadherin (LHN) and mammary associated amyloid (MAA) - have the potential to transform the human and animal health markets by being the first milk proteins to be deliverable in an edible algae format.

</p>
      
      <p>OPN - OPN is a powerful and effective protein, which interacts with multiple systems in the body of all mammals, including the immune system; it also supports bone growth/resorption and accelerates wound healing.  Additionally, OPN has been shown to induce production of immune cells, and to support brain and cognitive development.
</p>
<p>LHN - lactadherin is an important protein component of colostrum and milk, conserved across all vertebrates.  It supports the immune system; plays an important role in maintaining normal health of the intestinal mucosa, and; helps support natural defense against rotavirus infections, a common cause of nausea and diarrhea among infants and young children.</p>
<p>MAA - this is a protein found in the colostrum of all mammals, and helps stimulate production of a mucus coating in the digestive tract.  These coatings help to prevent colonization of pathogenic bacteria, minimize viral infection, and improve nutrient intake by the intestines.  It is active in mammals of all ages, and supports normal, healthy digestive function in humans, companion animals, and livestock.  </p>

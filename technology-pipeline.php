	<div class="big">Triton has a pipeline of safe and effective proteins, identical to those occurring in nature, and a powerful IP-protected platform from which to produce them.
</div>
	<p>The Triton platform enables production of a broad, diverse and valuable array of safe and effective - natural proteins.  These proteins including enzymes, antibodies, hormones and other biologically active proteins that represent multiple classes of proteins; including antibacterial, antioxidant, chelator, and mineral binding proteins.  Each of these proteins represents potentially high-value products in multiple market sectors, including infant formula, nutraceuticals, therapeutics and cosmetics.  The first proteins to emerge from Triton’s platform - osteopontin (OPN), lactadherin (LHN) and mammary associated amyloid (MAA) - have the potential to transform the human and animal health markets by being the first milk proteins to be deliverable in an edible algae format.

</p>
      
      <p>OPN - OPN is a powerful and effective protein, which interacts with multiple systems in the body of all mammals, including the immune system; it also supports bone growth/resorption and accelerates wound healing.  Additionally, OPN has been shown to induce production of immune cells, and to support brain and cognitive development.
</p>
<p>LHN - lactadherin is an important protein component of colostrum and milk, conserved across all vertebrates.  It supports the immune system; plays an important role in maintaining normal health of the intestinal mucosa, and; helps support natural defense against rotavirus infections, a common cause of nausea and diarrhea among infants and young children.</p>
<p>MAA - this is a protein found in the colostrum of all mammals, and helps stimulate production of a mucus coating in the digestive tract.  These coatings help to prevent colonization of pathogenic bacteria, minimize viral infection, and improve nutrient intake by the intestines.  It is active in mammals of all ages, and supports normal, healthy digestive function in humans, companion animals, and livestock.  </p>

		<p>Triton’s products can be used in multiple industries. </p>
        <p><strong>Animal health</strong> (livestock and pets) and <strong>human health</strong> (nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals): Triton will create products using its antimicrobials, intestinal health proteins, antioxidants, growth factors, and bone growth enhancers. These will be used to address diarrheal disease, improve nutrient uptake, enhance bone density and bone growth (e.g., addressing the effects of osteoporosis), mitigate chronic intestinal diseases (e.g., colitis), and as potent anti-cancer drugs.</p>
      <p><strong>Cosmetics:</strong> Triton plans to develop products for skincare, hair care, odor care, and personal hygiene using natural proteins. These include antibacterials, antioxidants, biosurfactants, and DNA repair enzymes. Examples of related products include UV protectants, anti-aging treatments, odor eliminators, hair volumizers, and general hair and skin care enhancers.</p>
        <p><strong>World health: </strong>Triton envisions its intestinal health products and vaccines being deployed for use in developing countries.  Because algae can produce these therapies at very low cost, they represent the first affordable treatments for these major health problems in low-income regions of the world. Triton’s products could be mixed with traditional foodstuffs to address diarrheal diseases (which annually claim more than 2.1 million lives in Africa and SE Asia alone) and parasitic diseases such as malaria (which kills over 800,000 people annually). Once deployed, these and other Triton products will represent a new paradigm in world health – Agricultural Pharmaceuticals.</p>
